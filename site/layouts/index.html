                <p class="rfs-10">A message for large consultancy firms and their consultants</p>
                <p>
                  Many of those working in large consultancy firms are friends, respected Agile practitioners, and competent Agile professionals trying to improve things from the inside. And then there are many graduates and junior consultants starting
                  their careers with energy, passion, and a strong will to do well. The content of this document is not intended as a reflection of their talent and professionalism but as a reflection of the solutions adopted and sold by the large
                  consultancy firms.
                </p>
                <p>The large consultancy firms are all invited to adopt Agile to run the consultancy firm at all levels:</p>
                <p class="rfs-8">&lt;&lt; Some things can’t be told. You live them or you don’t. But they can’t be told. &gt;&gt;</p>
                <p>
                  They are also invited to engage with the Agile community and are encouraged to act on the parts of the feedback that are constructive and useful, in order to accommodate the desire for the improvements needed by their clients and the
                  practitioners.

                      Now that Agile passed the early adopter stage, there are many companies interested in adopting it. Yet those companies without extensive Agile experience have a hard time evaluating what will bring them value and what not. Many of
                      the larger companies look at large consultancy firms and their solutions for scaling Agile and for Agile Transformations, and they don’t know if they can trust those or not. In this document members of the Agile community are
                      collecting and analysing available information. Some of these practitioners have been there, know how things started, how things went, and how they pan out with what results.

                    <p class="lead">Agile Software Development has started as a bottom-up movement coming from practitioners for practitioners working in professional software development.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                      In a moment when medium-large IT projects had more chances to fail than to succeed, a fundamental shift in the basic assumptions on how to approach professional software development had turned the tide with a streak of repeated
                      successes that brought Agile Software Development from a fringe movement into the mainstream.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                      During this period of time, a few small-medium size consulting firms in the tech sector adopted Agile Software Development as a means to succeed in their own mission of helping customers with challenging IT projects, as well as a way
                      to run their own company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One such consulting company worth mentioning is ThoughtWorks, which pioneered Agile Software Development, hired some of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, and made a reputation for themself for their rate of success with innovative
                      and challenging IT projects. Another one is Crisp.se from Sweden. Another one is Equal Experts.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                      With many products and services gradually becoming digital, software development started to be ubiquitous. At the same time the accelerating rate of change and innovation, the unknowns and uncertainties that challenged professional
                      software development from the advent of the Internet, started to become commonplace also for all types of organisations beyond tech and IT. This has been the start of the age that some may call the Information or Knowledge or
                      Interconnectivity Age. That is when Agile values, principles and techniques started to inspire larger enterprises and companies both from within and outside the Tech sector.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                      All this created a rapid expansion in the demand for Agile consulting services from companies willing to learn this new way of working, and it consequently created a rapid expansion of the Agile services market, at the same time when
                      the traditional management consulting market was declining.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="lead"></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                      This led several large traditional management consulting companies to rush their entry into the Agile services market without previous understanding or experience in Agile Software Development, or in adopting Agile to run their own
                      company, and without direct experience or alignment with the fundamental shift in the basic assumptions on how modern organisations work. To make things harder, the business model of large consultancy firms relies on the margins made
                      on junior consultants. So the large consultancy companies adopted solutions that their junior consultants could implement at the client site, and that resulted in simplistic solutions with the same limitations as the pre-Agile
                      approaches and unfit for the complexity of modern organisations.

                      In an opportunistic move dictated by the contraction of the traditional management consulting market, several large management consulting companies entered the rapidly expanding Agile service market without any previous knowledge,
                      understanding, or experience and ultimately without sufficient competence in Agile. And they equipped their junior consultants with simplistic solutions that perpetuate exactly the same limitation Agile is intended to overcome.<br />

                      Whereas Agile is based on an empirical approach that consists in starting from a small and intentionally incomplete starting point in order to gradually experiment, learn, adapt and evolve an approach that fits the different and
                      changing context and circumstances of every individual team, department, and organisation.

                      verifiable history of successes. Whereas the approach in the Agile community is to share and peer-review any new idea and contribution to the community in order to validate the idea, in a way that is very similar to the one used also
                      by the Open-Source movement.

                      Large consultancy firms that entered the Agile service market created an offering of solutions for scaling Agile and for Agile Transformations that ultimately consist in 1-size-fits-all canned solutions and standard recipes that are
                      polar opposites of good Agile and that don’t have any verifiable proof of working well other than marketing material.

                      <p>
                        In several of the articles analysed, there is a use of the language, the terminology, and the rhetoric commonly adopted from genuine Agile content, but those terms are used in the wrong context and with the wrong meaning on what it
                        seems a cheap imitation of counterfeit goods.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        One of the articles presents the made-up concept of Agile pools where a pool of identical replaceable generalist resources are dynamically moved around to work on new incoming tasks. Whereas Agile instead pursues productivity with
                        longstanding teams with stably dedicated team members, that are T-shaped in the sense that they are specialists and to some extent also generalists, and where the work moves to the teams and not the other way around.
                      </p>
                      <p>None of the alleged authors of the article has previous experience with Agile.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        Another article imitates the language of networked organisations, self-organisation in teams, and empirical approaches to work, while in the substance the article describes up-front planning, top-down management, and predefined
                        processes. Again, none of the alleged authors of the article has previous experience with Agile.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>In another article there is the made-up concept of an Agile Manager, the article imitates the language of the Spotify model but in the context of traditional top-down management.</p>
                      <p>Again the alleged author has no previous experience with Agile.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        Going back a few years in 2011 in the tech and IT space, reacting to the rising popularity of Agile Software Development, McKinsey was the proponent of another made-up idea they named “Two Speed IT.” A few years later after a
                        series of repeated failures the Forbes magazine, Boston Consulting Group as a former proponent of such an approach, and Martin Fowler who is one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, all rebuked that practice as fundamentally
                        flawed.
                      </p>
                      <p>The article is still available today in McKinsey as a suggested solution for their clients.</p>
                      <p>Again the alleged authors have no previous experience with Agile Software Development.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>McKinsey tends to sell very expensive plans for scaling Agile and Agile transformations to their clients while they often leave the burden of the execution to their clients.</p>
                      <p>Please note that Agile transcends the duality and separation of planning and execution because in Agile the two activities are inextricably intertwined, progressing in parallel in a process of gradual refinements.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        As several practitioners reported, several McKinsey clients tend to leave behind the plan bought from McKinsey when they start to experience the consequences of the fundamental flaws. Regardless, McKinsey clients don’t usually
                        speak publicly about their negative experience with a McKinsey “Agile Transformation.” Maybe because of the amount of money spent. But when asked personally they are open to admitting they have abandoned the recipes sold by
                        McKinsey because they did not work. Given the propensity of McKinsey to make up Agile terminology, it is possible sometimes to spot some clients that went through a McKinsey “Agile Transformation” because of some of the terms that
                        are still lying around, beyond the obvious Two Speed IT, and Agile Pools you can look for: North Star, Playbook, NWOW, CoE, Maturity Assessment, …

                      <p>
                        Around 2010, reacting to the rising popularity of Agile Software Development, Gartner suggested the idea of Bimodal IT that is very similar to McKinsey’s “Two Speed IT.” And sharing the same flaws it has been equally unsuccessful.
                        A few years later Forbes, Jez Humble author of Continuous Delivery and Accelerate, and Martin Fowler that is one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, rebuked that practice as fundamentally flawed.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>
                        In 2016 Gartner published an article that suggests a way to combine Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile. The diagram that imitates Agile diagrams has a certain success spreading beyond Gartner’s clients, and leads to a few
                        derivative variations. But a non-superficial reading immediately reveals the fundamental flaw: the three approaches are combined in a way that resembles a Waterfall linear gated process instead of an Agile approach.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>In December 2021 Gartner gave it another go mapping the skills for Agile developers, failing to map correctly the core skills versus other valuable but secondary skills and including irrelevant or detrimental skills.</p>
                      <p></p>
                      <p>All these flawed insights that Gartner shared with their clients still today are available for their clients.</p>

                        Accenture is not only a management consulting company but also a technical consulting company where their software development teams do not adopt Agile Software Development by default and are not known for mastering Agile either.

                      <p></p>

                        Accenture as a technical consulting company is not renewed for delivering IT projects on time, for their technical excellence, for their ability to succeed in challenging IT projects, or for mastering Agile Software Development as

                        While the management consulting branch of Accenture provides solutions for Agile Transformations based on SAFe with all the well-known flaws, limitations and problems that SAFe brings (see

                      <p>Accenture also created an extension of the already overcomplicated and heavyweight SAFe framework for the Automotive industry, calling it AutoScrum, which the Agile community has strongly criticised for its flaws.</p>

                      <p>
                        In some of their publications, they show a superficial understanding of Agile in the form of an iterative process applied to a traditional linear process consisting of a linear sequence of stages. This approach completely misses
                        the empirical nature of Agile which is one of the key elements that make Agile succeed where the previous approaches have failed.

                      <p>
                        In terms of publication of content Deloitte started off on the wrong foot by extending a graphical representation of the Agile practices by making it over-complicated while the relationship between the practices is oversimplified,
                        and the separation of the practices between strategy, planning, development and delivery while typical in traditional approaches is the polar opposite of Agile.

                      <p>
                        Typical Deloitte's offering for Agile Transformations consists of internal made-up solutions each defined like a traditional process consisting of a linear sequence of stages. Additional articles that detail the approach reveal
                        common misunderstandings around Agile that are expected from a beginner. For example in an article the Bimodal IT is described as a valid stepstone to Agile when the model is well known to have failed multiple times without
                        bringing any organisation closer to Agile. None of the alleged authors of the solutions and the articles has previous experience with Agile.

                      <p>
                        For scaling Agile Deloitte resorts to offering solutions based on SAFe with all the well-known flaws, limitations and problems that SAFe brings (see

                        its journey to gradually grow and evolve something that was a good fit for their own context and circumstances at the time, something very personal that is expected to continuously evolve and adapt. So this is the first mistake.

                      The offering of these large consultancy firms, coming from a position of authority derived from their brand and history, actually reveal their lack of competence in Agile and their lack of understanding of the key innovative elements

                      The demonstrated inability to react and adapt to the criticisms and to the failures of their canned solutions and standard recipes, the failure to engage with the Agile community to learn and to contribute, and the failure to empower
                      the experienced Agile practitioners among their employees, demonstrate their inability to adopt, practice and be Agile, and leave Agile experts wondering how can they help other organisation Agile journey when they cannot help their

                      While there is widespread public criticism of the flaws in the Agile offering of large consultancy firms, clients that failed to adopt a solution from one of those consulting firms are less prone to share their stories publicly.
                      While it is becoming more common for Agile practitioners and professionals to work with clients that are trying to recover from a previous failure with one of those consultancy firms.

                    <p>
                      On a less positive note, smaller or newly formed small consultancy firms without any Agile experience are trying to emulate these large consultancy firms in order to enter the market of Agile services. The number of smaller
                      consultancy firms trying to do that has raised so much leading to an offering of services to fake Agile expertise:

                      More than a sprint or even a marathon, adopting Agile in an organisation is more similar to running, an ongoing journey with many starting points, like many waves that at some point come together to form a bigger wave that turns the
                      tide.

                      Like any transformational process, adopting Agile cannot be outsourced or delegated, but is a journey that must be owned by the organisation itself, and all the missteps and mistakes are a necessary part of the development the
                      organisation needs to go through to learn the necessary skills and develop its Agility. Authentic and experienced Agile practitioners can help an organisation by providing some guidance, avoiding fatal mistakes, and helping the
                      journey like a steward or a sherpa.
